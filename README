WebGL Fireworks
Isaac Goldberg (igoldber) and Matt Nichols (man1)

This project demos the capabilities of WebGL. Our finished product models a mountainous island over which fireworks explode continuously. We feature full reflections of the fireworks, mountain range, and skybox. The mountains are randomly generated, but always have a depression (a lake) in the middle. They are multi-textured with images of dirt, rock, grass, and snow. Additionally, our lighting models the directional lighting of the moon.

Other technical challenges included:
- properly layering many transparent surfaces with varying depths (mountains, lake, reflections)
- overcoming the discrepancies in the GL implementations of OpenGL and WebGL
- optimizing performance for a web browser
- making the procedurally generated mountains realistic/visually appealing
- modeling the physics of fireworks (we have air resistance, gravity, velocities, accelerations, etc.)
- texturing the procedurally generated mesh
- fading the horizon line of the water into the skybox texture

To use the demo:
- serve the files on a web server (this is online at https://cs123-fireworks.vercel.app/ if desired)
- use a WebGL capable browser to view, newest versions of Chrome recommended
- navigate the scene with WASD to move and dragging the mouse to pan.
